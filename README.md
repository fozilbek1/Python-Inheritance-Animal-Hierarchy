# Python-Inheritance-Animal-Hierarchy
Explore the concept of Python inheritance through an illustrative animal hierarchy, ideal for beginners learning object-oriented programming. This script introduces a base Animal class with essential attributes and behaviors, while showcasing how subclasses such as Rabbit, Fish, and Hawk inherit and extend functionality from the parent class.

Features:
- Base Class: Animal class defines core attributes (alive) and common behaviors (eat, sleep).
- Subclasses: Rabbit, Fish, and Hawk extend the Animal class, introducing unique behaviors (run, swim, fly, respectively).
- Inheritance Benefits: Subclasses automatically inherit attributes and methods from the parent class, demonstrating code reuse and hierarchy in object-oriented programming.
- Learning Tool: Beginner-friendly example emphasizing inheritance's role in building hierarchical structures and extending functionality in Python programs.
